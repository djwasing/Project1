## What Is Scout? :round_pushpin:
A clean, quick ride-share comparison service which helps you save time and money. We compare Uber and Lyft prices along with estimated time of pick-up on a ride-by-ride basis to make sure you're always choosing the best ride for you.

## How Do You Use It? :bulb:
The Scout team developed the app with users in mind, so we've made the experience as simple as possible:

1. Allow Scout to access your current location by agreeing to the alert that pops up.

1. Enter your destination in the search bar (it will show a list of options to autocomplete as you type).

1. Click GO!

1. The results will show whether Uber or Lyft is cheaper by flashing the corresponding icon. You now know the best ride for your journey!

## What's Next? :dart:

* First order of business is to look at other ride-share services, as Uber and Lyft aren't the only options (depending on the town/city) and our aim is to find the best ride.

* Ideally we want users to be able to toggle which ride-shares they want to see. Not everyone has an account for each service, and some may want to limit results for other reasons.

* It'd be nice to have accounts that could then be linked to the user's ride-share accounts, thereby eliminating yet another step in finding the perfect ride.
